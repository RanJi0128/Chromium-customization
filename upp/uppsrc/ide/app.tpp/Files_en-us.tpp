by TheIDE C`+`+ builders. ]]
:: [s0; [*2 .h, .hpp]]
:: [s0; [2 Header files. C`+`+ builders provide automatic header dependency 
tests. U`+`+ packages tend to use ][*2 hpp][2  instead of ][*2 h][2  
in case that file contains template function definitions.]]
:: [s0; [*2 .icpp]]
:: [s0; [2 This file type is recognized as .cpp source file, but unlike 
regular .cpp, which might be placed into the library first and 
eventually eliminated by linker, .icpp one is always linked as 
object file. This forces the file to be always linked. The rationale 
of this is that you can put module initialization code into .icpp 
that is linked into the executable even when code is not referenced 
from other files.]]

:: [s0; [2 Java files (Android builder).]]
:: [s0; [*2 .rc]]
