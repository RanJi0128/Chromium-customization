[s1; Tcc&]
[s0; Tcc is a wrapper for Tiny C Compiler.&]

[s0; [* About Tcc package]&]
[s0;* &]
[s0; Tcc wrapper is based mainly in the TCC dynamic code generation 
characteristics. This feature lets to compile, link and run a 
C program in memory so that C language can be used as an scripting 
language. However it is also possible to get the program in a 
file to be run later from a terminal.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*/ If running in memory]&]
[s0; As many functions as necessary in the Tcc C script can be called 
from the main program. Because of it there is no need for any 
`"main()`" function.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; All static and global variables will be lost between function 
calls. All durable storage has to be located in the main program.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*/ If compiling to a file]&]
[s0; The file is a standalone native program so it requires a main() 
function with command line arguments if necessary.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Tcc uses exceptions so any compiling problem can be caught from 
the main program.&]

[s0; [* About TCC]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Tiny C Compiler (TCC) is an x86 C compiler created by Fabrice 
Bellard. TCC is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public 
License (LGPL).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; TCC main features are:&]
[s0;i150;O0; Small: DLL size is 200Kb&]
[s0;i150;O0; Fast: It compiles much faster than GCC or MSC (however 
code is slower)&]
[s0;i150;O0; It can be used as a backend for dynamic code generation&]
