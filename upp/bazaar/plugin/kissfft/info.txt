version 1.29 from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft/

didnt touch the files at all, except for default double change in kiss_fft.h,
tools folder simply merged into main folder, to make include semantic right.

some minor changes:

kiss_fastfir.c:76 from float to
    kiss_fft_scalar scale;

added the flag
#ifdef flagFAST_FILT_UTIL

kiss_fastfir.h added with some of the cpp contents to be able to use the 2 major functions
directly
